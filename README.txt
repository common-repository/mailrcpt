Integrate MailRCPT in Wordpress.

== Description ==

This plugin will integrate [MailRCPT](http://www.mailrcpt.com/) in your Wordpress blog. It allows users to subscribe to your mailinglists directly from wordpress, see all the available mailing lists and browse send mailings directly in your blog. And a bunch more like a widget that displays the send mailings of a specific mailing list.

Remember 1: suggestions are more than welcome!
Remember 2: **this plugin is still under heavy development**. Use it at your own risk.

== Installation ==

1. Go to **"Plugins"** > **"Add Plugin"**
2. Search for **"MailRCPT"**
3. Click **"Install Now"**
4. Activate the plugin

Note to use this plugin you need to have a account at MailRCPT, it's free so no worries there.
